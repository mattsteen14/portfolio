### Portfolio Project: Personal Portfolio Website

As per the project brief I built a personal portfolio website on HTML & CSS using GIT version control via the command line on terminal. I developed it locally on my computer mainly on Visual Studio Code. The site is responsive to smaller vertical screen configurations. My goal while wireframing was spread content horizontally for wider screens then cascade vertically for smaller screens.

***For the interactive element I chose to integrate my immatureGreeting function code that I created for the previous portfolio project on Javascript syntax called Mixed Messages. For this I created an Immature Greeting Generator where if you press a button one of the greetings will be generated. You can pick 1 of 3 options based on gender.***

This has been a really valuable & rewarding project. It has built my confidence in styling with CSS, especially with setting consistent spacing, padding & margins. I have never actually integrated javascript into HTML before so I felt proud when I got that to work with the Immature Greeting Generator (after a lot of troubleshooting, mind you).
